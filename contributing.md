# Contributing to g-hack


A [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/usfKjHUE/g-hack) is used to make sure this project is on the right track. The routine of contributing is as following:

### 1. Pick an urgent card in User stories.
### 2. Write a specific ticket in TO-DO list in order to implement one or multiple aspects in the card.
### 3. Modify the local code from git, and test on AWS EC2 server.
       works --> push to remote
       does not work --> discard the change; convert the change in AWS
### 4. Drag the ticket to to-be-tested field, and wait someone else to check if the implementation meets the testing criteria .
